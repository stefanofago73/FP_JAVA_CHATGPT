A set of examples of a hypothetical Functional Programming course, developed with ChatGPT... between an experiment and a joke

## WHAT INSIDE

For the examples involving functors, cofunctors, and natural transformations, the main classes and interfaces used include:

- Functor<T> and Cofunctor<T>: These are interfaces representing a type that can be mapped over in a forward or backward direction, respectively.

- FMap<F, T> and CofMap<F, T>: These are interfaces representing a function that maps a value of type F to a value of type T in a forward or backward direction, respectively.

- NaturalTransformation<F, G>: This is an interface representing a natural transformation from the functor F to the functor G.


For the examples involving monads and monad transformers, the main classes and interfaces used include:

- Monad<T>: This is an interface representing a type that supports monadic operations such as unit, bind, and map.
- Maybe<T>: This is a class representing a monad that may or may not contain a value of type T.

- IO<T>: This is a class representing a monad that performs I/O operations and returns a value of type T.

- MonadTransformer<M, T>: This is an interface representing a monad transformer that takes a monad M and transforms it into a new monad that includes additional effects.
